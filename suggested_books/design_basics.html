            <p>Itten wrote this book to share the fundamental principles that he taught all his students (no matter how advanced) before allowing them to pursue higher classes and goals at his school.</p>
            <b>The Elements of Color</b>

            <b>Basic Principles of Design - The Foundation Program at the School of Design, Basel, Switzerland</b>

            <b>Visual Literacy: A Conceptual Approach to Graphic Problem Solving</b>

            <b>Interaction of Color : Revised Edition</b>
            <p>by Josef Albers</p>

            <p>Revised version is useful, but not nearly as comprehensive and in depth as the original hardcopy. Still a worthwhle read from a master theorist! Better than a good read is to get a hold of a packet of Colored Paper and replicate some of the assignments in the book. Best way to learn.</p>

In the mid-1940s he introduced a visual design program to the MIT School of Architecture. Those were the first seeds for the development of the Visual Language Workshop, now part of the Media Lab.</p>
