            <h1 class="heading">MISSION STATEMENT</h1>
            <p>Mcwebspace.net is the website for the Moorpark College Graphic and Multimedia Design (GMD) program offering degree path guidance for current and prospective students who need to know the recommended ideal order in which to take program courses. Moorparkcollege.edu provides course descriptions but neither adequately provides GMD students with degree path information nor a space for prospective students to see examples of what they can learn studying in the GMD program. Mcwebspace.net provides degree path information for students from enrollment to graduation. Additionally, exemplary work produced by our department students is featured for prospective students to view.</p>
